Minute 0:00–0:45 — Set the frame (Kumar, whole room)

“Before we talk about features or demos, I want to reset the frame.”
“What you’re about to see is not a chatbot on top of a database. We’ve all seen that. This is something different.”
“Models are getting better every year for everyone. That’s not where differentiation will live.”
“The real question is: how does intelligence accumulate inside a system over time?”
“What we’re building is our answer to that.”

Minute 0:45–1:45 — What we built (Aditya, Vishram)

“Instead of one monolithic AI, we’ve built a small team of agents—each with a distinct role—designed to collaborate the way a real analyst team would.”
“One agent decides what matters. One analyzes impact. One investigates root causes. One explains results in human terms.”
“The key architectural idea is separation of concerns:
  - reasoning is decomposed,
  - memory is externalized,
  - and execution happens through tools.”
“This isn’t prompt choreography. It’s a control plane for reasoning.”
“Each agent can evolve independently. Nothing is hard-coded into a single prompt.”

Minute 1:45–2:45 — The real shift (Anubhav, skeptics)

“The real shift isn’t that AI answers better questions.”
“The shift is that humans no longer have to decide how to interrogate data step by step.”
“We’re delegating that thinking to the system—while keeping everything auditable, explainable, and reversible.”
“Every investigation has traces.
  - Every conclusion has receipts.
  - Every learning loop can be reviewed or rolled back.”
“This is not autonomy-first. It’s judgment-first.”

Minute 2:45–3:45 — Why this gets better over time (Rajat, competitive lens)

“Most AI systems answer questions and forget.”
“Our system remembers how problems were solved.”
“Each investigation leaves behind artifacts:
  - what we looked at,
  - what worked,
  - what didn’t,
  - and what mattered.”
“Over time, that becomes institutional memory the system can reuse.”
“This is how intelligence compounds without retraining models.”
“Anyone can copy agents. What’s hard to copy is years of accumulated judgment inside customer workflows.”

Minute 3:45–4:30 — Why this is a beta (everyone)

“This is a beta not because it’s fragile, but because we’re early in a compounding curve.”
“Today, the agents are constrained to financial impact analysis. That constraint is a sandbox—not a limitation.”
“The architecture doesn’t change when we expand domains. Only the tools and memory do.”
“What matters isn’t what the system knows today—it’s that it gets better at knowing tomorrow.”

Minute 4:30–5:00 — Close with alignment (strong ending)

“We’re not claiming this is AGI.”
“We’re claiming this is the smallest viable system that can:
  - decide what matters,
  - explain why it decided,
  -  and improve how it decides over time.”
“Models will commoditize. Institutional memory compounds.”
